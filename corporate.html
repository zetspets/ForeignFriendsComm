          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The color scheme: We chose a range of bright colors that work together to represent <strong>inclusivity</strong> and <strong>diversity</strong>. Embracing a sense of community as we expats are all different but still united.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #078C41;"></span>
              #078C41
                  
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #f22233;"></span>
              #f22233
                  
            </li>
			  <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #23c0d5;"></span>
                #23c0d5
                  
            </li>
			  <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #f26e22;"></span>
                #f26e22
                  
            </li>
			  <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #813418;"></span>
                #813418
                  
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The initial idea for our logo was a variety of petals with all kinds of colors, from sharp to soft and from bright to dark, symbolizing <strong>diversity</strong> of people, mindsets and cultures, all united in one circle in the middle, as in some countries there are even traditional dances where people are holding hands creating a moving circle which symbolizes <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>friendship</strong>, which in the end results in a beautiful flower which symbolize the values of our company and how inclusivity and <strong>open-mindedness</strong>&nbsp;can create something wonderful.&nbsp;In the final version we needed to cut a bit our flower to include the name of the company to properly follow the rules of logo but the main ideas behind our design remain the same.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>As a font it was chosen Agrandir family fonts and the reason might be a little surprising: it is very basic! Let me explain: we wanted to appear as neutral as possible as we promote interculturalism and Agrandir is perfect for it, it is not too think, not too thin or not too casual so anyone can interpret it in their own way based on their background and mindset.</li>
<li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <li>The most important information is plastered on the home page for ease to the user. As our target group consists of people aged 18-29, it is important that the grabbing factors of our brand and product are quick and easy to find upon first glance. More in-depth information about the brand and the team are on the 'About Us' page as this information is still important but since this content would take more words than visual aspects, it would take away from the crucial information on the home page. Of course the content that surrounds the products we offer is on the shop page to give the user easy access.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li> <strong> &nbsp;</strong>The home page features a carousel of images to quickly grab the attention of the viewer with buttons that will direct them around the website relating to the text on the image (EX: "Our Cultures" leads to the 'About Us' page). There is also a grid in the middle displaying the sample products as a way to cohesively show off our product. On the 'About Us' page there are cards displaying our main values as the card become the focal point causing the user to pay more attention to the values. The cards are also more pleasing to the eye as the lines create direction.&nbsp;</li> 
			  <li> The website functions as a promo product gallery to display what Bites will have to offer in the future. This is not in attmept to gain funding but instead to gain traction and attention from the target audience. </li>
            <li>Related to other units:
              <ul>
                <li> The design of the websites the the fit<strong> values and personality </strong>of the brand because of it's clean, clear, and concise layout. The elements are also attracted to looks at due to the bright colors that are reflected in our logo and brought back in throughout the website.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The website design fits the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>marketing and communication strategy </strong>by<strong>&nbsp;</strong>being bright and colorful to attract theuser's eye to the most important parts of our brand, the values and products. The copy across the website is also very attractive and encourages the user to learn more about the brand.&nbsp;</li>
                <li> Our website combines the best of bringing people together in a wide community and a love for food that is reflected in our&nbsp;<strong> unique value proposal of the product.</strong></li>

Specifically, we aim to reach 150 followers and 450 interactions on Instagram, 250 followers and 510 interactions on Facebook, and 48 followers and 200 interactions on LinkedIn."</p>

	  <p>Media and Communication Plan for Bites</p>

	  <p>Communication Message and Objectives:</p>
<p>Bites' communication message is centered around the power of food to bring people together and promote inclusivity. Our objectives for this campaign are:</p>

<p>Reach Objectives: We aim to reach a minimum of people per week through our social media channels, website, and email marketing campaigns. We will do that by posting 2-3 times a week. The posts content will be as relatable and as engaging as possible, as we want to create a sense pf community.</p>

<p>Affect Objectives: We want to create a sense of community and inclusivity around food and encourage our target audience to feel a sense of connection and belonging.</p>

<p>Response Objectives: We want our target audience to engage with our brand and take action by ordering a Bites food box, sharing our content on social media, or joining our community events.</p>

	  <p>Justification:</p>
<p>Our communication message and objectives are based on the core values of our brand and the needs of our target audience. By emphasizing the power of food to bring people together and promote inclusivity, we hope to create a sense of connection and belonging among our customers.  </p>

<p>Our reach objectives are ambitious but achievable given the size of our target audience and the potential for social media marketing to reach a large number of people. By focusing on affect objectives, we hope to create a strong emotional connection with our target audience that will lead to increased engagement and loyalty. </p>

<p>Finally, our response objectives are designed to encourage our target audience to take action and engage with our brand, such us liking, commenting, and sharing our posts. Also tagging their friends on our posts and posting on their personal account using our hashtag. We want to create that sense of community and pride to be a part of our brand.
</p>
	  <p>We chose Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook.</p>

<p>At bites we wanted to connect with our followers in a personal way. We used 3 channels to make sure that we can reach our people in more than one platform, if they switch platform then they will see us and there will be a bigger chance of them remembering us. We chose Instagram due to its popularity among all social media users, LinkedIn due to its professional environment and many expats are active on it to be up to date within the industry and their co-workers and finally Facebook due to the huge popularity of expats groups.</p>

<p>Overall, our Media and Communication Plan is designed to promote our message of inclusivity and community, and the feeling of belonging. By focusing on our reach, affect, and response objectives, we aim to create a strong emotional connection with our target audience and build a loyal customer base.
</p>
	  <ul>Moving on to our Marketing Strategies
<li>We made an excel sheet of the content calendar, where it states when are we posting what. </li>
<li>We made a research and found the best hours and days to post on the social media platforms that we chose. (Needle, 2023) As for the posts, we will focus on food related posts as they gain a lot of reach because basically everyone loves food. Also we will use reels to gain more reach, as advised by our marketing lecturer Jeffrey Dekker.</li>
<li>We will share our social media accounts on groups, with our fellow students to support us and maybe family/friends from outside.</li>
	  </ul>
<p>Content calendar: The content calendar can be accessed via this link: <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/212174_buas_nl/EUb_SdSrkyJBvYipBezHx-UB8zAA_D8-L-ur568PmOtR5g?e=d1QVNM" target="_blank">Content Calendar</a>(Appendix G) </p> <p>All the days and hours are chosen according to (Needle, 2023) they state when users are most active on the platform.</p>



<p>Now that we have presented all of the above, execution was not easy. We underestimated the workload with our other subjects in creative business, therefore we lacked in content. We had issues posting on the scheduled times in the excel sheet sometimes we were a day or two late. In the beginning we wanted to try to let the account grow without us pushing It in Buas WhatsApp groups just like our competitors do, and that resulted in very low engagement and followers count. The reason we decided to do that is because we wanted to experiment if we would be able to catch any followers from the target audience without having our fellow students support us. The result as mentioned before was not good.  
</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During the duration of the project, we have learned several important things about communication and media planning. First, I learned the importance of understanding the target audience and tailoring the campaign to their needs and interests. This helped us to create more effective messaging and reach the desired audience more efficiently.</p> 
<p> Second, I learned that having clear and measurable objectives is essential to evaluating the success of the campaign. By setting specific goals and tracking our progress, we were able to make adjustments along the way and optimize our efforts for maximum impact.</p> 
<p> Third, I learned the value of using multiple accounts and tactics to reach the target audience. Yet we still need to know and learn how to manage it and be active on all 3 different platforms as it was a struggle.</p> 
<p> In terms of what worked and what didn't, we found that our social media campaigns were most effective when we shared it with our peers. However, we struggled with reaching our desired objective goals and getting people to interact with our brand. Also reels was a huge success compared to other picture posts, our first reel got a 200+ views within 10 days and the highest likes of 17 as of the date of writing this report. </p> 
<p> Hashtags: It is hard for use to identify if hashtag totally worked, as in increased our followers or something. Although we did receive a comment from an account called “Europe_community003”, which makes us think that there’s a possibility to use hashtags to our advantages, in the future I would do more research about it, to make sure to use it in the most efficient way possible.</p>
<p> Social media platforms: in the beginning I would like to state that choosing 3 platforms to be active on was not the best choice for this project, it was overwhelming to stay active and find ways to grow in all 3 platforms in such a small team and basically an individual moderating the social media platforms. I will not mention Facebook and LinkedIn as we unfortunately received little to no followers on those platforms.</p>
<p> Instagram: Instagram was our biggest success out of all 3, by the time of writing this we have 48 followers, 54 likes and 4 comments. Our biggest learning moment here was how easier it is to get reach on reels compared to posts, it was advised by Jeffrey Dekker, and we tried it, the results was surprising as mentioned above. Another point we would like to further investigate is that we reached 162 non follower accounts with that reel, yet our follower count didn’t increase much after that reel. We want to know why they did not follow and how can we change that in the future.</p>

<img alt="social stats" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/igstats.png">
<p>Overall, I would approach the campaign differently by investing more heavily in targeted advertising and email marketing to personal marketing such as spreading flyers. I would also incorporate more interactive and engaging content into our social media campaigns to better capture the audience's attention and build stronger connections with them. I would also assign a team for producing the content, as it was difficult to assign group members to create the content and get it done in time. We believe this is one of the main reasons we did not meet our objective and goals.</p>


          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If the campaign were to continue, I would recommend conducting more extensive research on the target audience to better understand their needs and motivations. This would help us to tailor our messaging and tactics even more effectively.</p>

<p>I would also recommend implementing a comprehensive measurement and evaluation plan to track the success of the campaign and make ongoing adjustments as needed. This could include regular reporting on key metrics such as reach, engagement, and conversion rates.</p>

<p>Finally, I would suggest exploring new and innovative tactics for reaching the target audience, such as influencer marketing or experiential events. By continuously testing and iterating on our approach, we can ensure that the campaign remains relevant and effective over time.</p>

<p>In terms of the marketing assignment, I would apply the same principles of research, measurement, and innovation to future projects. We learnt that creating a brand is not simple, yet it is very interesting. If this campaign would continue, we would focus on the product because it helps the target audience understand the brand image more.
</p>
<p>It is important to mention that some of the future planning and things we would do different has been mentioned in the learning points, as it was easier to write and explain as we were identifying the issues we faced and what we learnt from them.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>All posts were posted on all social medias the same.</p>

          <h2 id="management" class="mt-5">Management</h2>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h4>

          <p>Fill in at least 2 bullet points per building block and according to the rubrics.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the problem interviews (Appendix A), there were identified several problems like missing home, not liking or being tired by Dutch food, the need to explore different food cultures, cultural misunderstanding especially with Dutch people, having hard time finding other people from the same country based on answers. However, the only ones that were aligned with our product strategy were selected for the first lean canvas (Appendix D). </li>

<li>After coming up with definite product (Appendix C) and solution interviews (Appendix A), there were discovered surprisingly more problems that our product could solve like having hard time finding exotic ingredients and not having enough time to go around shops to buy it as well as no opportunity to share the expat’s culture with others (Appendix E). Those problems were then sorted out to be secondary in the final lean canvas. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the problem interviews (Appendix A), the main solutions to the main problems were already found, for example connecting to other cultures through cooking and eating international food and so on (Appendix D) and after the solution interviews (Appendix A) the main solution features were proved/ confirmed and new minor ones were discovered like being able to share your culture through food and so on along with new minor problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Out of all the options for the target audience our team chose expats because we have insights into this audience, by being part of it, and having people to interview from this audience.</li>  

<li>After the problem interviews (Appendix A), it was decided to narrow it down to young adult expats, aged from 18 to 29 years old, in Netherlands (Appendix D) because our team realized that we do not have the opportunity to interview older part of expats and that different generations has different problems and we cannot focus to solve all of the expats’ different age segments’ problems with one product. </li>

<li>After the solution interviews (Appendix A), we decided to split the target audience into 2 segments that have similar problems and to which our product is a solution. At first it was split into currently studying expats and graduated ones (Appendix E), but analyzing the interviews once again gave a better idea of splitting based on the country of origin since our range of products is based on different food cultures. We also identified better early adopters based on characteristics as creative (because they would need to like to cook and try and create new recipe), curious and adventurous (because they would need to like to try new products that are not popular yet). </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the problem interviews (Appendix A), the initial value proposition was focused more on making expats miss their home less through food (Appendix D), but after coming up with definite product (Appendix C) and solution interviews results (Appendix A), we switched on discovering different cultures through food (Appendix E). After some analysis though, we combined both versions into one. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our being composed of people from different backgrounds (USA, Moldova, Egypt) and being part of the target audience ourselves, gives us great advantage of knowing about some cultures and their food as well as some insights of the situation of the market and customer segments. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the problem interviews (Appendix A), it was decided to use home delivery and it would be one of the popular third-party delivery services like Uber, Thuisbezorg or Flink (Appendix D) as we would not need to set up a whole delivery process ourselves from scratch and it would give a good marketing boost to appear on the apps of those services. </li>
            <li>However, after some research and solution interviews’ results (Appendix A), the best decision appeared to be Flink because it specializes more on the products, rather than made dishes, they have storages across Netherlands (so we could send out products there from our main storage) and people ordering our package could as well order other extra ingredients from the same app (because we do not include in our packages meat or fish to have a further expiration date). </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Initially key metrics were just the number of sales (Appendix D), but after the solution interviews (Appendix A) it was decided to also keep track of the engagement levels of the brand’s social media (Appendix E) since usually this specific target audience is quite active there so the engagement of social media is every close related to overall popularity and success of a product. The final improvement in this block was related to the channel of delivery because since we have access to Flink data we could track the popularity of our product compared to other products from the same platform. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The easiest and the most obvious revenue structure would be selling food packages through Flink. The package price would need to be to be higher than all the expenses in order to make a profit, so it was decided to try to sell it for 5 euros. The price was tested at the solution interviews (Appendix A) and approved, even being mentioned paying more if ingredients and recipes are authentic as possible. </li><li>Extra features (not part of the canvas but worth mentioning): </li>
          <li>After the solution interviews (Appendix A) there were some discoveries from the interviewed target customers on what extra feature they would like to see in the product: </li>
          <li>Story pamphlets – it was mentioned not one time that it would bring extra satisfaction to the customer if there would be a fun fact or the story of origin of the dish that they order so people would learn more about different food cultures (we would implement it into a QR code on the packaging that leads to our social media post about a fun fact or story of origin of that specific dish). </li>
          <li>QR code for an explaining video – it was also mentioned more than once that it would be nice to have a QR code on the package that sends you to a tutorial video on how to cook the dish that you bought the package for rather than just text instructions (taken into consideration but too expensive for a small startup company to also make a platform where the tutorial videos, which also costs to produce, could be uploaded). </li>
          <li>Souvenirs – some people proposed including a small souvenir inside the food package (like a small pyramid if it is an Egypt package) like happy meal with Mcdonalds (taken into consideration but for now too many extra costs). </li>
          <li>Existing alternatives (not part of the canvas but worth mentioning): </li>
          <li>After conducting problem and solution interviews (Appendix A), the alternative for the target audience was buying ingredients themselves. However, this was not a full solution because it was mentioned that some exotic ingredients are hard to find as well as not having enough time going through different shops. </li>
          <li>Another alternative is a company that also does food packages (Appendix C). However, this option was not known by interviewed people showing that this product is more focused on the Dutch Target audience. </li>
          
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of goods (ingredients, packages and the import of the products) – variable </li>
            <li>Percentage to the delivery service and delivery fee (Flink) - variable </li>
			  <li>Salary of the employers – variable </li>
			  <li>Other expenses - variable </li>
			  <li>Taxes – variable </li>
			  <li>The rent of storage – fixed </li>
			  <li>The rent of the truck – fixed </li>
			  <li>Cost per unit = 2.9 euros (Appendix B) </li>
			  
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our product (Appendix C) is designed for expats to reconnect with their culture and discover other cultures through cooking and eating food which aligns completely with our brand values like inclusivity (because we try to include as many cultures as possible through our products, for example creative Spanish, Russian, Egyptian, American dishes for the expats from these countries), authenticity (because we use authentic ingredients and recipe from the country where the dish is from) and community (because our product was designed to be also used as a group and shared, for example Spanish people meeting to cook a Spanish package and then also share it with people from other cultures). </li>
          </ul>
